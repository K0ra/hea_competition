# Diabetes-only run. Uses all non-target columns from the model table as features.
# Importance comes from the trained model (e.g. feature_importances_); see model/*_importances.csv.
# Optional: set feature_columns to a list to restrict to those columns.

# Data subset: use sample_fraction (0-1, e.g. 0.8 for 80%) and/or sample_rows (absolute).
# sample_seed (int) used when sample_fraction is set for reproducibility.
# Omit both to use all rows.

# lgbm handles missing features natively (production-friendly). lr/rf require complete cases.
